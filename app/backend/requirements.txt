# httpx version will be resolved by supabase dependency (requires httpx>=0.24.0,<0.25.0)
# Note: chromadb may require httpx>=0.28.0 which conflicts with supabase
# This is a known issue - functionality should still work despite the warning
# Note: Mantle packages removed as they're not used in the backend
# The code uses httpx directly for Mantle RPC calls
